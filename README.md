# Install Guide
- Download and install Cheat Engine: https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php
- Download the Cheat Table: https://github.com/644/dmc3cheats/releases/download/v1.0/dmc3hax.zip
- Open Cheat Engine
- Start DMC3SE (this only works for a legit 2006 port Steam version)
- In Cheat Engine, click the "select process to open" (top left) and select dmc3se.exe and click "open"
- In Cheat Engine, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>
- Open the unzipped "dmc3hax.ct" file
- It will ask if you want to run the script, click "yes"

That's it

### The hotkeys for using the script are as follows
- <kbd>F1</kbd> - Loads any saved state (and in style switcher, with hotkeys enabled, resets the room)
- <kbd>F5</kbd> - Saves the state of your Royal Guard gauge, Devil Trigger, items, and health
- <kbd>F6</kbd> - Automatically saves the state whenever you enter a new room, press <kbd>F6</kbd> again to disable
- <kbd>F7</kbd> - Gives you infinite Royal Guard gauge, Devil Trigger, items, and health, press <kbd>F7</kbd> again to disable

Happy hacking
